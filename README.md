# Bottom Terminal

## Features
Adds a Terminal button to the bottom of the window to open the terminal.

## Known Issues
Due to VSCode limitations you can't detect the active panel tab. As a result if you click on a panel tab or close it, you may need an additional click to show the terminal again.
